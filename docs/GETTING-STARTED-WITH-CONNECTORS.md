# Getting Started with Connectors

**Your first connector in 30 minutes** ‚è±Ô∏è

Welcome! This guide will walk you through creating your very first connector from start to finish. We'll keep it simple and explain everything as we go.

---

## üìö Documentation Overview

We have several guides to help you:

| Guide | When to Use It |
|-------|----------------|
| **This Guide** (You are here) | First time creating a connector - start here! |
| [How to Add a Connector](./HOW-TO-ADD-A-CONNECTOR.md) | Comprehensive step-by-step guide with detailed explanations |
| [Quick Reference](./CONNECTOR-QUICK-REFERENCE.md) | Copy-paste examples for common field types and patterns |
| [Workflow Guide](./CONNECTOR-WORKFLOW.md) | Visual workflows, decision trees, and checklists |

**Recommendation**: Read this guide first, then keep the Quick Reference open while you work!

---

## üéØ What We'll Build

We're going to add a simple connector for **Linear** (a project management tool) with API key authentication.

**Why Linear?**
- Simple authentication (just an API key)
- One variant (no complexity)
- Clear API endpoint to test
- Perfect first connector!

By the end, you'll have:
- ‚úÖ A working connector in the UI
- ‚úÖ A form that collects the API key
- ‚úÖ A test that verifies credentials
- ‚úÖ Documentation for users

**Time needed**: About 30 minutes

---

## üöÄ Let's Get Started!

### Step 1: Find a Template (3 minutes)

1. **Open** the connectors file:
   ```
   svelte-frontend/src/data/connectors.ts
   ```

2. **Search** for "activtrak" (Ctrl+F or Cmd+F)

3. **Copy** everything from `{` (line 6) to `},` (line 49)
   - This is the entire ActivTrak connector
   - We'll use it as our template

4. **Scroll** to the bottom of the file (before the closing `];`)

5. **Paste** the copied code

**What you should see:**
```typescript
// ... other connectors above ...
  {
    id: 'activtrak',  // ‚Üê We'll change this
    slug: 'activtrak',
    name: 'ActivTrak',
    // ... rest of ActivTrak connector
  },
];
```

### Step 2: Customize Basic Info (5 minutes)

Now let's make it our own! Replace these values:

**Find and Replace:**

| Find | Replace With |
|------|--------------|
| `activtrak` (in id) | `linear-demo` |
| `activtrak` (in slug) | `linear-demo` |
| `ActivTrak` | `Linear Demo` |
| `Monitor and analyze employee productivity with comprehensive workforce analytics` | `Streamline your software development workflow` |
| `activtrak.com` | `linear.app` |

**Update the documentation paths:**
```typescript
documentationPath: '/docs/integrations/linear-demo/index.md',
```

**Your connector should now look like this:**

```typescript
{
  id: 'linear-demo',
  slug: 'linear-demo',
  name: 'Linear Demo',
  description: 'Streamline your software development workflow',
  icon: 'https://img.logo.dev/linear.app?token=pk_N2gy3fJKQ0aldg9QTg7cHA',
  enabled: true,
  documentationPath: '/docs/integrations/linear-demo/index.md',
  supportUrl: 'https://docs.askparable.com/getting-api-keys/',
  prioritized: false,
  connected: false,
  variants: [
    // ... we'll update the variant next
  ],
},
```

### Step 3: Update the Variant (5 minutes)

Inside the `variants: [ ]` array, update the variant:

**Change these values:**

```typescript
variants: [
  {
    id: 'linear-demo-api-key',  // Changed from activtrak-api-key
    name: 'API Key',  // Keep same
    description: 'Personal API key authentication',  // Changed
    authMethod: 'API_KEY',  // Keep same
    recommended: true,  // Keep same
    documentationPath: '/docs/integrations/linear-demo/api-key.md',  // Changed
```

### Step 4: Update the Form Field (5 minutes)

Update the field that collects the API key:

```typescript
formFields: [
  {
    __typename: 'SecretField',
    id: 'linear-demo-api-key',  // Changed
    key: 'apiKey',  // Keep same
    label: 'API Key',  // Keep same
    description: 'Your Linear personal API key',  // Changed
    required: true,  // Keep same
    widget: 'PASSWORD',  // Keep same
    mode: 'WRITE_ONLY',  // Keep same
    revealable: false,  // Keep same
  },
],
```

### Step 5: Update the Test Config (5 minutes)

This tells the system how to verify the API key works:

```typescript
testConfig: {
  id: 'linear-demo-test',  // Changed
  method: 'HTTP_POST',  // Changed! Linear uses POST
  endpoint: 'https://api.linear.app/graphql',  // Changed
  timeoutMs: 5000,  // Keep same
  expectedResponse: {
    statusCode: 200,  // Keep same
    successMessage: '‚úì Connected to Linear',  // Changed
    failureMessage: '‚úó Invalid API key',  // Keep same
  },
},
```

### Step 6: Save and Check! (2 minutes)

1. **Save** the `connectors.ts` file

2. **Check for errors**:
   - Make sure there's a comma after your connector
   - Check all brackets are closed
   - No missing quotes

3. **Your complete connector should look like this:**

```typescript
{
  id: 'linear-demo',
  slug: 'linear-demo',
  name: 'Linear Demo',
  description: 'Streamline your software development workflow',
  icon: 'https://img.logo.dev/linear.app?token=pk_N2gy3fJKQ0aldg9QTg7cHA',
  enabled: true,
  documentationPath: '/docs/integrations/linear-demo/index.md',
  supportUrl: 'https://docs.askparable.com/getting-api-keys/',
  prioritized: false,
  connected: false,
  variants: [
    {
      id: 'linear-demo-api-key',
      name: 'API Key',
      description: 'Personal API key authentication',
      authMethod: 'API_KEY',
      recommended: true,
      documentationPath: '/docs/integrations/linear-demo/api-key.md',
      formFields: [
        {
          __typename: 'SecretField',
          id: 'linear-demo-api-key',
          key: 'apiKey',
          label: 'API Key',
          description: 'Your Linear personal API key',
          required: true,
          widget: 'PASSWORD',
          mode: 'WRITE_ONLY',
          revealable: false,
        },
      ],
      testConfig: {
        id: 'linear-demo-test',
        method: 'HTTP_POST',
        endpoint: 'https://api.linear.app/graphql',
        timeoutMs: 5000,
        expectedResponse: {
          statusCode: 200,
          successMessage: '‚úì Connected to Linear',
          failureMessage: '‚úó Invalid API key',
        },
      },
    },
  ],
},
```

### Step 7: See It in Action! (5 minutes)

1. **Open your terminal** and navigate to the project:
   ```bash
   cd svelte-frontend
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser** to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

4. **Look for your connector!**
   - Scroll through the list
   - Find "Linear Demo"
   - Click on it

5. **Verify**:
   - ‚úÖ Name shows as "Linear Demo"
   - ‚úÖ Description is correct
   - ‚úÖ Icon loads (Linear logo)
   - ‚úÖ Form shows "API Key" field
   - ‚úÖ Help text is visible
   - ‚úÖ Test Connection button appears

**Congratulations! You've created your first connector!** üéâ

## üìù What We Learned

In just 30 minutes, you:

‚úÖ Found and copied a template connector  
‚úÖ Customized basic information (name, description, icon)  
‚úÖ Updated the variant and form field  
‚úÖ Configured the test endpoint  
‚úÖ Saw your connector in the live UI  
‚úÖ (Optional) Tested with real credentials  

**Key Concepts You Now Understand:**

| Concept | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| **Connector** | An integration with a third-party service (like Linear) |
| **Variant** | A way to authenticate (API Key, OAuth, etc.) |
| **Form Field** | Input that collects information from users |
| **Test Config** | How to verify credentials work |
| **__typename** | Tells the system what type of field to display |

---

## üéì Next Steps

### Option 1: Add Documentation (Recommended)

Make your connector production-ready by adding user docs:

1. Create folder: `docs/integrations/linear-demo/`
2. Add `index.md` (overview)
3. Add `api-key.md` (setup instructions)

**See**: [How to Add a Connector](./HOW-TO-ADD-A-CONNECTOR.md) ‚Üí Step 7

### Option 2: Add More Fields

Make your connector more powerful:

**Try adding:**
- A toggle for "Enable webhooks"
- A dropdown for "Team workspace"
- A multi-select for "Sync labels"

**See**: [Quick Reference](./CONNECTOR-QUICK-REFERENCE.md) ‚Üí Common Field Types

### Option 3: Add Another Variant

Services often support multiple authentication methods:

**Try adding:**
- OAuth variant (in addition to API Key)
- Different variants for Cloud vs Self-Hosted

**See**: [How to Add a Connector](./HOW-TO-ADD-A-CONNECTOR.md) ‚Üí Option B

### Option 4: Build a Real Connector

Now that you understand the basics, add a real connector your team needs!

**Popular requests:**
- Asana (project management)
- HubSpot (CRM)
- Stripe (payments)
- Twilio (communications)
- Zendesk (support)

## üîç Common Questions

### Q: Why didn't my connector appear in the UI?

**Check these:**
1. Did you set `enabled: true`?
2. Did you save the file?
3. Did you restart the dev server? (Ctrl+C, then `npm run dev`)
4. Any syntax errors in the console?

### Q: I got a syntax error. What do I do?

**Common fixes:**
1. Check for missing commas between fields
2. Make sure all quotes match (use `'` or `"` consistently)
3. Verify all brackets are closed `{ }` and `[ ]`
4. Look at the line number in the error message

**Example error:**
```
Error: Unexpected token at line 123
```
Go to line 123 and check for missing comma or bracket.

### Q: How do I know what endpoint to use for testing?

**Check the service's API documentation:**
1. Look for "Authentication" section
2. Find "Test your credentials" or similar
3. Usually an endpoint like `/api/v1/user` or `/api/me`

**If no test endpoint exists:**
Use `method: 'VALIDATE_FORMAT'` to just check the format.

### Q: Can I test my connector without real credentials?

**Yes!** Use format validation:

```typescript
testConfig: {
  method: 'VALIDATE_FORMAT',
  // No endpoint needed
}
```

This just checks if the format looks right (e.g., email is valid email format).

### Q: What if I want to change the order of connectors?

**Easy!** Just move your connector up or down in the `connectors.ts` file. The UI shows them in the order they appear in the file.

## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Use the Quick Reference

Keep the [Quick Reference](./CONNECTOR-QUICK-REFERENCE.md) open in another tab. It has copy-paste examples for every field type.

### Tip 2: Copy from Similar Connectors

Look at existing connectors that are similar to yours:

| Your Service Type | Copy This Connector |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Simple API Key | `activtrak`, `linear`, `notion` |
| OAuth | `slack`, `google-admin` |
| Has subdomain | `salesforce`, `jira`, `okta` |
| Self-hosted | `gitlab`, `jira` (on-premises) |

### Tip 3: Test Early and Often

Don't wait until you're done to test. Check after each step:
1. Add connector ‚Üí restart ‚Üí check UI
2. Add field ‚Üí restart ‚Üí check UI
3. Add test ‚Üí restart ‚Üí try connection

### Tip 4: Use Descriptive Help Text

Good help text makes a huge difference:

**‚ùå Bad:**
```typescript
description: 'API key'
```

**‚úÖ Good:**
```typescript
description: 'Your Linear personal API key. Find this in Settings ‚Üí API ‚Üí Create new key'
```

### Tip 5: Add Instructions in the Form

Use a `MarkdownField` to guide users:

```typescript
{
  __typename: 'MarkdownField',
  key: 'instructions',
  widget: 'MARKDOWN_DISPLAY',
  mode: 'READ_ONLY',
  content: `## How to get your API key

1. Go to Linear Settings
2. Click on API tab
3. Create a new personal API key
4. Copy and paste it here`,
}
```
